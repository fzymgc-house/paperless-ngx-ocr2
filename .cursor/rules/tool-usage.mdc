# Tool Usage Priority Rules

## Core Principle
Always prefer using available tools over scripts, direct web access, or manual operations. This ensures better integration, error handling, and consistency.


Remember: Tools provide better integration, error handling, and consistency than manual operations. Always prefer tool usage when available.
